His most notable achievement is the creation of the AC induction motor and the polyphase AC system, which revolutionized the field of electrical engineering and power distribution. The 'War of the Currents' between Tesla\"s AC system and Thomas Edison\"s direct current (DC) system ultimately led to the widespread adoption of AC power, which is the dominant power distribution system used today.\n\nTesla held over 300 patents worldwide and his ideas and innovations continue to influence modern technology, earning him a reputation as one of the most innovative scientists and engineers in history."
